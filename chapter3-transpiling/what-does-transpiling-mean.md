# 3.1 What does it mean to transpile your code?

Transpiling means “translating” code that’s written in one language (or a version of it) to the equivalent code written in another language (or a different version).
For example, code that’s written in ES6, JSX or in TypeScript can be transpiled to ES5, which is understood and supported by all browsers.

In this tutorial, we’ll use Babel as transpiler or source-to-source compiler.
